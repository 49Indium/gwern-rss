# gwern-rss
A quick script that takes the Gwern changelog (https://gwern.net/changelog) and turns it into a RSS feed. Note that this is not made by Gwern, just someone wanting an RSS feed of his site.

Requires the packages [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [FeedGenerator](https://pypi.org/project/feedgenerator/). Run with `python gwern-rss.py` with output sent to to `feed.rss`.
